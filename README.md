Just an update to ItzKiba's Grandpa Demon Mod. I obviously can't upload this to Geode as I don't have ItzKiba's approval. Therefore, you have to set this up for your specific platform!

If you know how to use Github & Cmake, you can make the .geode file. ( Linux not working rn :( )

More information can be found here: https://docs.geode-sdk.org/getting-started/prerequisites

If Geometry Dash or Geode updates, you might have to change "mod.json" on your own if I don't update this.
